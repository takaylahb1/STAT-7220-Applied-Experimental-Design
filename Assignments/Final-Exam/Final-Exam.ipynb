    "Let's say you own a new food truck called **Buster's Breakfast Burritos**. To determine the best ingredients for your burritos, and as a means of minimizing food (and money) waste, you decide to conduct an experiment. Specifically, you want to investigate the following treatments:\n",

After each participant has tasted their randomly assigned burrito, you ask them to rate the burrito on a scale of 1 to 10 (1 = terrible, 10 = amazing).

    "2. State the outcome variable and how it was measured.\n",
    "\n", Satisfaction score.

Measured on a 1–10 scale, where 1 = terrible and 10 = amazing, based on tasting the burrito
    "3. State the main effects. What lurking variables may be present?\n",

Lurking Variables: 
Time of day

How hungry the person was
Temperature/freshness of the burrito

Who prepared it (if more than one cook)

    "\n", a full factorial lets you:

Estimate all main effects and all interactions (e.g., Protein×Salsa).

This is important because preference for salsa might depend on protein, etc.

Aliasing prevents separation of main effects from two-factor interactions

Sales may be affected by unmeasured outside factors (weather, events, etc.)

    "Please briefly repond to the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How do we de-alias the main effects and interactions in a fractional factorial design? Why is this important? Why may it not always be feasible?\n",
    "\n", It’s important because aliasing means you cannot tell whether a detected effect is due to the factor itself or an interaction that is confounded with it.

However, running a foldover or a larger design may not always be feasible due to limited time, cost, or logistical constraints.
    "2. In all of our assignments, I have had you specify/consider a lot of characteristics of an experiment before getting into the analysis. Why is this good practice?\n",

Clear research questions

Proper randomization, replication, and blocking

Valid statistical inference
    "3.  What is the most important thing you learned in this class?"
   ]
  } The most important thing I learned was how experimental design and statistical analysis work together. Understanding factorial designs, interactions, and ANOVA helped me see how to structure experiments that produce clear and interpretable results. I also learned the importance of checking model assumptions and thinking critically about limitations when drawing conclusions
