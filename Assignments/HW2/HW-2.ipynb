    "**PART 1 INSTRUCTIONS:** You are an educational researcher interested in comparing different methods for teaching data science to undergraduate students. There are three different methods you are interested in comparing: (1) Direct Instruction (traditional method); (2) Inquiry-Based Learning (teacher facilitates student problem solving); (3) Collaborative Learning (students working in small groups). To compare these methods, you decide to randomly recruit undergraduate data science students to be part of a workshop on hypothesis testing basics. Students will be randomly assigned to one of three workshops, where each workshop employs a different teaching method. At the end of the workshop, students will be given a 50-question quiz where their understanding of hypothesis testing will be assessed. Percentage scores on this quiz serve as the outcome of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it would be apparent that the prior level of knowledge a student possess about hypothesis testing may serve as a potential confounding variable that you would want to control for. Thus, the Prior Knowledge a given student has about hypothesis testing is categorized into \"High\" and \"Low\". The data from this experiment are contained in the `Data Science Teaching Method.xlsx` file. With these data, your tasks are:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 1.** Briefly define the objective of this experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 2.** Specify the outcome variable\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 3.** Specify the independent variable and blocking factor. What are some possible lurking variables?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 4.** Briefly explain why a randomized block design would be appropriate here. Similarly, explain why a completely randomized design would not be appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 5.** State the null and alternative hypotheses for this experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 6.** Perform appropriate exploratory analysis, including summary statistics **and** data visualizations. Do the results of these analyses support the null or alternative hypothesis more strongly?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 7.** Build a two-way ANOVA model. Test the assumption of normality using **both** a visual method and a testing method. Do the results of the normality test(s) support the assumption of normality?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 8.** Test the assumption of homogeneity of variance using **both** a visual method and a testing method. Do the results of the test(s) support the assumption of homogeneity of variance?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 9.** Report the F-statistic and its associated p-value for the treatment effect. Which of our two hypotheses is more strongly supported? Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 10.** If the data more strongly support the alternative hypothesis, perform Tukey's HSD post-hoc test to determine which levels of the treatment effect are significantly different from each other. If the data more strongly support the null hypothesis, explain why a post-hoc test would not be appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 11.** Write a brief, contextual conclusion summarizing the results of your analyses, including potential limitations of this experiment.\n",

    "**PART 2 INSTRUCTIONS**: Now suppose a university is evaluating the effectiveness of four different online learning platforms (say A, B, C, and D) on student engagement for students taking an undergraduate data science course in an online synchronous format. One section of the course is offered Monday through Thursday in the Morning, Early Afternoon, Mid-Afternoon, and Evening sections. Student engagement is measured through the total number of logins to the online learning platform for a given course section over the course of the\n",
