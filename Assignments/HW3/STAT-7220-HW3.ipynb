    "A running shoe manufacturer wants to optimize the comfort of a new shoe model. They've identified three factors they believe will affect comfort:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Factor | Level 1 (-) Description | Level 2 (+) Description |\n",
    "|------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------|\n",
    "| Sole Material (A) | Standard EVA foam | Advanced gel-infused foam |\n",
    "| Insole Thickness (B) | 3mm | 6mm |\n",
    "| Fabric Breathability (C) | Standard woven fabric | High-performance mesh fabric |\n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate the comfort of the $2^3=8$ runs, the manufacturer will recruit 3 NCAA division one cross-country athletes to test a randomly assigned shoe. Each athlete will run on a treadmill for 30 minutes in the shoes and rate the comfort on a scale of 1-10 (1 = very uncomfortable, 10 = very comfortable). The results of this experiment are contained in the `Shoe Comfort Experiment.xlsx` file. With these data, I want you to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Briefly describe the objective of the experiment.\n",
    "\n",  Find which factor levels and interactions produce the most comfortable shoe for NCAA D1 cross-country athletes, measured on a 1–10 comfort scale.
    "2.  Specify the outcome variable and how it is measured.\n",
    "\n", The outcome is Comfort, a numeric rating from 1 (very uncomfortable) to 10 (very comfortable).
Each rating is provided by an athlete after a 30-minute treadmill run in the assigned shoe
    "3.  Specify the independent variables. What lurking variables may be present?\n",
    "\n",  Independent variables are A: Sole Material (EVA vs gel), B: Insole Thickness (3mm vs 6mm), and C: Fabric Breathability (woven vs mesh).
Possible lurking variables include athlete fitness, foot shape, prior shoe preferences, treadmill calibration, sock type, and fatigue.
    "4.  Explain the difference between a full factorial design and a $2^k$ factorial design. Briefly comment on why the latter may be preferred in this case.\n",
    "\n",   A full factorial (here 2^3) tests every combination of factors and estimates all main effects and interactions independently.
A fractional factorial uses fewer runs and confounds (aliases) some effects to save time/cost.
    "5.  State the sets of null and alternative hypotheses for this experiment.\n",
    "\n",  For each main effect and interaction the null (H₀) states there is no difference in mean comfort between the factor levels (e.g., µ₍A−₎ = µ₍A+₎).
    "6.  Perform appropriate exploratory analysis, including data visualizations. Do the results of these analyses support the null or alternative hypotheses more strongly?\n"

  }, The exploratory plots, including boxplots and interaction plots, show how comfort scores differ across the levels of A, B, and C.

    "Due to time and resource limitations, the company would rather conduct a $2^{3-1}$ fractional factorial experiment. For each of the above runs, the company will recruit 3 NCAA division one cross-country athletes to test a randomly assigned fitness band. Each athlete will use the band for one month during their competition season. At the end of the month, the athletes will be asked to rate their level of satisfaction on a scale of 1-10 (1 = very dissatisfied, 10 = very satisfied). The results of this experiment are contained in the `Fitness Band Experiment.xlsx` file. With these data, I want you to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Briefly describe the objective of the experiment.\n",
    "\n", Identify which band features (GPS accuracy A, battery life B, display C) most increase runner satisfaction after one month.
The company wants to screen important factors efficiently to guide product design.
    "2.  Specify the outcome variable and how it is measured.\n",
    "\n", Outcome is Satisfaction rated 1–10 after one month of use.
Each athlete provides one numeric score summarizing their experience.
    "3.  Specify the independent variables. What lurking variables may be present?\n",
    "\n",  Independent variables: A = GPS Accuracy (standard vs high), B = Battery Life (6 vs 12 hours), C = Display (small vs large).
Lurking variables include environment (urban/rural), phone compatibility, training load, firmware problems, and personal tech preferences.
    "4.  Explain the difference between a full $2^k$ factorial design and a $2^{3-1}$ fractional factorial design. Briefly comment on why the latter may be preferred in this case.\n",
    "\n", Full factorial (8 runs) estimates all effects unconfounded; fractional (4 runs) saves time and resources by running a half-fraction.
Fractional is preferred here because testing each band for a month is time-consuming and costly.
    "5.  State the sets of null and alternative hypotheses for this experiment.\n",
    "\n", Use p-values and effect sizes to judge practical vs statistical significance.
    "6.  Assuming a defining relation of $I=ABC$, specify the aliasing structure of the design. What does this mean for the interpretation of the main effects and interactions?\n",
    "\n", That means any estimated main-effect contrast (e.g., A) actually represents the sum of the true A effect and the BC interaction
